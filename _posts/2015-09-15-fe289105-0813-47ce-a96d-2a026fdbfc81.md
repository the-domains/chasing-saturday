# This is Your Life

One of my favorite song writers, Jon Foreman, penned the phrase, "this is your life, are you who you want to be?" This is an image, taken by my friend Jay. It reminds me of who I want to be. Where I want to be. Where I want to look. The only thing lacking in this image is my family, though they travel with me wherever I go. I'm not yet who I'm meant to be. I will be.
